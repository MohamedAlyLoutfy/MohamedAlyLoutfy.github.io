Introduction
======
In the ever-evolving field of fluid mechanics, the integration of machine learning offers a groundbreaking approach to solving complex, data-rich problems that traditional methods have struggled to tackle efficiently. This paper delves into how advanced machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning, are being adapted to not only understand but also predict the dynamic behaviors of fluids under various conditions. By embedding physical laws directly into machine learning models, researchers are pioneering a hybrid approach that marries theoretical physics with empirical data-driven insights.
