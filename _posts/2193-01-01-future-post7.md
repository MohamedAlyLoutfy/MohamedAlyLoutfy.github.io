The Optimization Algorithm
======
Optimization algorithms are essential for training machine learning (ML) models by finding the parameters (θ) that best fit the training data. 

High-Dimensional and Non-Convex Problems:
ML optimization problems are typically high-dimensional and non-convex, creating challenging optimization landscapes with many local minima.
Few generic guarantees exist for convergence or global optimality in non-convex optimization.

Techniques for Convex Optimization:
There are powerful and generic techniques available for convex optimization problems.

Deep Neural Networks:
Modern deep neural networks have particularly high-dimensional parameters and require large training datasets.
Stochastic gradient descent algorithms are commonly used due to their effectiveness in handling large datasets and high-dimensional spaces.

Role of Optimization Algorithms:
Optimization algorithms are the engine powering ML, often abstracted from the decision process.
Advanced optimization algorithms are a major focus of research, aiming to improve convergence and performance.

Architecture and Loss Term Considerations:
When designing new architectures or incorporating novel loss terms, it is often necessary to explicitly consider the optimization algorithm to ensure effective training.

In summary, optimization algorithms are crucial for training ML models, especially in the context of high-dimensional and non-convex problems typical of modern deep learning. They enable the practical application of ML by finding the best-fitting parameters, and their development is a critical area of research to enhance model performance and efficiency.

Embedding physics in the Optimization Algorithm
======
Embedding physical knowledge into the optimization algorithm involves customizing or modifying it to incorporate prior physical constraints. Key methods include:

Adding Constraints:
Explicit constraints, such as ensuring certain coefficients are non-negative or satisfy specific algebraic relationships.
Enforcing physical properties like energy conservation or stability through constraints within the optimization process.

Custom Optimization Algorithms:
Developing algorithms tailored to minimize physically motivated loss functions, which are often non-convex.
The line between the loss function and optimization algorithm is often blurred due to their interdependence.
Examples include promoting sparsity with the non-convex L0 norm, where relaxed optimization formulations are used.

SR3 Optimization Framework:
The Sparse Relaxed Regularized Regression (SR3) framework is designed to handle challenging non-convex loss terms in physically motivated problems.

2.5.2 Examples in Fluid Mechanics
======
In fluid mechanics, embedding physics into optimization algorithms has shown practical applications:

Energy Conservation:
Loiseau demonstrated enforcing energy conservation for incompressible fluid flows by imposing skew-symmetry constraints on quadratic terms in a SINDy model.
These constraints are implemented as equality constraints on the sparse coefficients (θ) in the SINDy model.
The standard SINDy optimization procedure uses sequentially thresholded least-squares, allowing enforcement of these constraints at each regression stage via Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions.

SR3 Optimization Package:
Developed to extend and generalize constrained optimization problems to more complex constraints and generic optimization issues.
This package illustrates the creation of custom optimization algorithms to train ML models with novel loss functions or architectures.

In summary, embedding physics into optimization algorithms involves incorporating physical constraints and developing custom algorithms to handle physically motivated, often non-convex, loss functions. This integration ensures that ML models remain physically accurate and efficient, with specific applications in fluid mechanics demonstrating the practical benefits of these methods.
