The Problem
======
This section outlines the key steps in applying machine learning (ML) to fluid mechanics, emphasizing how prior physical knowledge can be integrated at each stage.

Choosing the Problem: Selecting the specific fluid mechanics issue to model or the question to answer.
Curating Data: Deciding on and preparing the data used to train the ML model.
ML Architecture: Selecting the appropriate ML architecture to best represent or model the data.
Designing Loss Functions: Creating loss functions to measure performance and guide the learning process.
Optimization Algorithm: Implementing algorithms to train the model by minimizing the loss function over the training data.
These steps are interconnected, often requiring iterative revisits and refinements based on outcomes at each stage. The discussion highlights the iterative nature of ML workflows, where researchers constantly refine the problem, data, architecture, loss functions, and optimization algorithms to enhance performance.
The section provides a high-level overview of embedding physics into ML processes and reviews examples specific to fluid mechanics, offering references for more detailed information .

Embedding physics in the problem
======
Choosing what phenomena to model with machine learning (ML) is closely linked to the underlying physics. Traditionally, ML has been used for static tasks like image classification, but it is increasingly applied to model physical systems that evolve over time. Examples include:
Modeling conserved quantities, such as Hamiltonians, purely from data.
Representing time-series data as differential equations, where the learning algorithm captures the dynamical system.
Learning coordinate transformations to simplify dynamics, such as linearizing or decoupling them.

Examples in Fluid Mechanics
======
Machine learning is making significant contributions to various physical modeling tasks in fluid mechanics:
Turbulence Closure Modeling: Applying ML to learn models for Reynolds stresses or sub-grid scale turbulence.
CFD Solvers Improvement: Enhancing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers with ML.
Super-Resolution: Improving resolution in fluid simulations.
Robust Modal Decompositions: Developing better methods for modal analysis.
Network and Cluster Modeling: Using ML for network and cluster analysis in fluid systems.
Control and Reinforcement Learning: Applying ML for fluid control and optimization tasks.
Design of Experiments: Enhancing experimental design in cyber-physical systems.
These problems inherently embed the learning process within a larger physics-based framework, ensuring that the ML models remain physically relevant and accurate.
