Physics-Informed Machine Learning
======
This section outlines the key steps in applying machine learning (ML) to fluid mechanics, emphasizing how prior physical knowledge can be integrated at each stage.

Choosing the Problem: Selecting the specific fluid mechanics issue to model or the question to answer.
Curating Data: Deciding on and preparing the data used to train the ML model.
ML Architecture: Selecting the appropriate ML architecture to best represent or model the data.
Designing Loss Functions: Creating loss functions to measure performance and guide the learning process.
Optimization Algorithm: Implementing algorithms to train the model by minimizing the loss function over the training data.

These steps are interconnected, often requiring iterative revisits and refinements based on outcomes at each stage. The discussion highlights the iterative nature of ML workflows, where researchers constantly refine the problem, data, architecture, loss functions, and optimization algorithms to enhance performance.

The section provides a high-level overview of embedding physics into ML processes and reviews examples specific to fluid mechanics, offering references for more detailed information .
