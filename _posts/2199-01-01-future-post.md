Motivation
======
Machine learning presents a vast potential for solving various optimization problems in fluid mechanics, such as designing aerodynamic shapes or managing turbulent flows.
The complexity and high-dimensional nature of fluid dynamics align well with the capabilities of machine learning to handle and model extensive datasets.
The integration of machine learning into fluid mechanics is part of a broader trend of applying advanced computational methods in the physical sciences.

Problem
======
Machine learning in fluid mechanics is challenging because it requires continuous expert guidance at every phase, from defining the problem and data curation to selecting appropriate machine learning architectures and optimization algorithms.
The process involves intricate decision-making regarding data that informs the model, ensuring that the outputs are based on feasible inputs.
There's a critical need to balance between machine learning potential and realistic modeling capabilities, particularly against traditional numerical methods.

History
======
The historical development of using machine learning in fluid mechanics is rooted in the broader adoption of computational methods across various scientific domains.
Previously, disciplines such as computer vision and natural language processing have seen substantial benefits from machine learning, setting a precedent for its application in more physically oriented fields.
The integration of machine learning into fluid mechanics represents a convergence of traditional model-based approaches with newer, data-driven techniques, highlighting an evolution in scientific methodologies and problem-solving approaches.
