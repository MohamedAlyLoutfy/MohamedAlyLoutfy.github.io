Introduction
======
 Fluid mechanics is data-rich and presents many complex optimization problems that ML is well-suited to handle. Examples include optimizing wing design, estimating flow fields, and controlling turbulence for various engineering applications.

  ML can provide surrogate models for fluid behaviors or directly solve fluid optimization tasks.
  The process of implementing ML in fluid mechanics is not automatic and requires expert human intervention at each step, from problem definition to model training and optimization. Despite the successes of ML in fields like computer vision and natural language processing, its application to physical sciences, including fluid mechanics, is still emerging and comes with both optimism and skepticism. 

  Researchers are eager to understand how to best integrate ML with existing research methods. While training ML models for well-defined tasks is relatively straightforward, creating models that outperform traditional methods remains challenging. Incorporating known physics into ML models can enhance their generalization, interpretability, and explainability, which are crucial for modern ML applications.

Physics-Informed Machine Learning

Choosing the Problem: Selecting the specific fluid mechanics issue to model or the question to answer.

Curating Data: Deciding on and preparing the data used to train the ML model.

ML Architecture: Selecting the appropriate ML architecture to best represent or model the data.

Designing Loss Functions: Creating loss functions to measure performance and guide the learning process.

Optimization Algorithm: Implementing algorithms to train the model by minimizing the loss function over the training data.

These steps are interconnected, often requiring iterative revisits and refinements based on outcomes at each stage. The discussion highlights the iterative nature of ML workflows, where researchers constantly refine the problem, data, architecture, loss functions, and optimization algorithms to enhance performance.

The section provides a high-level overview of embedding physics into ML processes and reviews examples specific to fluid mechanics, offering references for more detailed information .
