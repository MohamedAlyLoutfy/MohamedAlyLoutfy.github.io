Introduction
======
 Fluid mechanics is data-rich and presents many complex optimization problems that ML is well-suited to handle. Examples include optimizing wing design, estimating flow fields, and controlling turbulence for various engineering applications. 
 
  ML can provide surrogate models for fluid behaviors or directly solve fluid optimization tasks.
  The process of implementing ML in fluid mechanics is not automatic and requires expert human intervention at each step, from problem definition to model training and optimization. Despite the successes of ML in fields like computer vision and natural language processing, its application to physical sciences, including fluid mechanics, is still emerging and comes with both optimism and skepticism. 

  Researchers are eager to understand how to best integrate ML with existing research methods. While training ML models for well-defined tasks is relatively straightforward, creating models that outperform traditional methods remains challenging. Incorporating known physics into ML models can enhance their generalization, interpretability, and explainability, which are crucial for modern ML applications.
